## Overview
We developed HitAnno, a scalable model built on a hierarchical transformer architecture for accurate cell type annotation on large scATAC-seq datasets. HitAnno constructs “cell sentences” by leveraging accessibility profiles on cell-type-specific peaks, capturing the epigenomic cell heterogeneity. The model adopts a two-level attention mechanism to capture both peak-level and peak-set-level dependencies, enabling hierarchical feature integration for reliable annotation performance.
